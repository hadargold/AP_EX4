# AP_EX4
This repository holds a CPP code that handles a server-client connection.
The purpose of the connection is calculating the best route between source and destination
based on several known search algorithms (e.g. DFS, BFS and more).

The code demonstrating a seperation between an abstract solution and concrete implementation of it, i.e. 
seperation between the pseudo-solution of data structure that holds the next node to develop
and BFS that uses a stack to choose which is the next node to develop.

Another seperation is between a method of connection to a specific one, i.e. one vs multi connection to the server.
